Inspired by a [project I completed](https://codepen.io/Ceecee-Hart/pen/abrJgYR) last year from [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/ref=clevermissfox) , as well as a digital art project im working on with waveforms. Big thanks to wavesurfer which made this so simple, it feels like cheating, not to say it wasnt challenging; felt good to stretch my brain a bit to remember how to style ranges/sliders,  debug when things weren't working and spend too long on a record functionality before realizing it wasnt allowed in codepen , it wasnt my error (but duh, of course it isn’t allowed! I should’ve known that!) 

Please let me know if you run into any issues!
